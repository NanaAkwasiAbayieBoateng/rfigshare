Getting Started
---------------

## Get a Personal Access Token

Also known as a PAT. Get it from your Figshare account at [figshare.com/account/applications](https://figshare.com/account/applications)

Store the token as an env var in your `.Renviron` file like `RFIGSHARE_PAT=<your figshare PAT>`

We'll look for this token while using this package. 

You can optionally pass in this token to function calls, but we strongly discourage that because

1. the token is long, making calls cumbersome while passing in as an argument
2. passing your secret PAT as a parameter in R is insecure

# Using rfigshare


```{r}
library("rfigshare")
```

Try a search for an author:


```{r}
fs_author_search("Boettiger")
```



Try creating your own content:


```{r}
id <- fs_create("Test title", "description of test")
```


This creates an article with the essential metadata information. We can now upload the dataset to this newly created figshare object using `fs_upload`.  For the purposes of this example, we'll just upload one of R's built-in datasets:


```{r}
data(mtcars)
write.csv(mtcars, "mtcars.csv")
fs_upload(id, "mtcars.csv")
```


Not that we must pass the id number of our the newly created figshare object as the first argument.  Similar functions let us add additional authors, tags, categories, and links, e.g.


```{r}
fs_add_tags(id, "demo")
```



Minimal metadata includes title, description, type, and at least one tag and one category.  We can add categories using either the category id or the name of the category, but it must be one of the preset categories available.  We can ask the API for a list of all the categories:


```{r}
fs_category_list()
```


And we can add the category or categories we like,


```{r}
fs_add_categories(id, c("Education", "Software Engineering"))
```



The file we have created remains saved as a draft until we publish it, either publicly or privately.  Note that once a file is declared public, it cannot be made private or deleted.  Let's release this dataset privately:


```{r}
fs_make_private(id)
```


We can now share the dataset with collaborators by way of the private url.  

### The quick and easy way

The `rfigshare` package will let you create a new figshare article with additional authors, tags, categories, etc in a single command usnig the `fs_new_article` function.  The essential metadata `title`, `description` and `type` are required, but any other information we omit at this stage can be added later.  If we set `visibility` to private or public, the article is published on figshare immediately.  


```{r}
data(mtcars)
write.csv(mtcars,"mtcars.csv")
id <- fs_new_article(title="A Test of rfigshare", 
                     description="This is a test", 
                     type="dataset", 
                     authors=c("Karthik Ram", "Scott Chamberlain"), 
                     tags=c("ecology", "openscience"), 
                     categories="Ecology", 
                     links="http://ropensci.org", 
                     files="mtcars.csv",
                     visibility="private")
unlink("mtcars.csv") # clean up
```


# Examining Data on Figshare

We can view all available metadata of a figshare object. 


```{r}
fs_details(id)
```

You can see all of the files you have (Currently only up to 10):


```{r}
mine <- fs_browse()
mine[1:2]
```

Note that we can easily grab the ids with the wrapper function `fs_ids`:



```{r}
fs_ids(mine)
```


We can delete unwanted files that are not public with `fs_delete`:  


```{r}
fs_delete(id)
```

To cite package `rfigshare` in publications use:


```{r}
citation("rfigshare")
```
